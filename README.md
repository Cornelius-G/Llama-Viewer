**Hi, I'm Llama and I will help you log your analyses so you can keep track of all of them.**

The **Llama Viewer** is an electron app that allows you to interactively explore the results of your logging (see [Llama.jl](https://github.com/Cornelius-G/Llama.jl) and [Llama.py](https://github.com/Cornelius-G/Llama.py) for how to generate logs). 
It gives you an overview of your logged analyses and lets you sort and filter them as well as allow to inspect plots, so you quickly find what you are looking for.
Llama Viewer will soon available as executables for Windows, macOS, and Linux). In the mean time, you can run it using Node.js as described below.
