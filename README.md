**Hi, I'm Llama and I will help you log your analyses so you can keep track of all of them.**

The **Llama Viewer** is an electron app that allows you to interactively explore the results of your logging (see [Llama.jl](https://github.com/Cornelius-G/Llama.jl) and [Llama.py](https://github.com/Cornelius-G/Llama.py) for how to generate logs). 
It gives you an overview of your logged analyses and lets you sort and filter them as well as allow to inspect plots, so you quickly find what you are looking for.

**NOTE**

**Llama Viewer** will soon be available as executables for Windows, macOS and Linux. 
In the meantime, you can run it with Node.js as described below.
